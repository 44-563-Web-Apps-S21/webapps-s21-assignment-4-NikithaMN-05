                The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
                Without a burthen: time as long again
                Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
                And yet we should, for perpetuity,
                Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
                Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
                With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
                That go before it.</p>

                <p class="speech polixenes">Sir, that's to-morrow.
                I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
                Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
                No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
                'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
                To tire your royalty.</p>
               <h6 class="name">LEONTES</h6>
                <p class="speech leontes">We are tougher, brother,

                I'll no gainsaying.</p>
                <h6 class="name">POLIXENES</h6> 
                <p  class="speech polixenes">Press me not, beseech you, so.
                There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
                So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
                Were there necessity in your request, although
                'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
                Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
                Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
                To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
                Farewell, our brother.</p>

                You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
                Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
                All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
                The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
                He's beat from his best ward.</p>
