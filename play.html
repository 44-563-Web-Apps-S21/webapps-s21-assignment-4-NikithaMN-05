            <h1>Nikitha presents</h1>
            <h2> A room of state in the same</h2>
            <h3>Act 1, Scene 2: A room of state in the same -<p>Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants</p></h3>
             <p><h6>POLIXENES</h6> 
                Nine changes of the watery star hath been
                The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
                Without a burthen: time as long again
                Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
                And yet we should, for perpetuity,
                Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
                Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
                With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
                That go before it.</p>
               <p> <h6>LEONTES</h6>
                Stay your thanks a while;
                And pay them when you part.</p>
                <p><h6>POLIXENES</h6>
                Sir, that's to-morrow.
                I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
                Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
                No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
                'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
                To tire your royalty.</p>
               <p> <h6>LEONTES</h6>
                We are tougher, brother,
                Than you can put us to't.</p>
               <p></p> <h6>POLIXENES</h6>
                No longer stay.</p>
              <p><h6>LEONTES</h6>
                One seven-night longer.</p>
               <p><h6>POLIXENES</h6>
                Very sooth, to-morrow.</p>
               <p><h6>LEONTES</h6>
                We'll part the time between's then; and in that
                I'll no gainsaying.</p>
                <p><h6>POLIXENES</h6>
                Press me not, beseech you, so.
                There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
                So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
                Were there necessity in your request, although
                'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
                Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
                Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
                To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
                Farewell, our brother.</p>
